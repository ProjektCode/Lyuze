An multi-purpose discord bot written in VB.Net Core

## Setup

 There are some things you need to do to set up this discord bot for yourself:

* ***API Keys:*** You wi
* ***Builds(Coming Soon):*** Don't know how to build your character? Well, this has some builds you can get an idea from!
* ***Exp Calculator(Coming Soon):*** Don't know how many books it takes to get to a certain level? Here's how.
* ***Character Info(Coming Soon):*** Want to know more about a character? Their skills? Lisa's Birthday? Let it be known who you simp for.
* ***Weapon Info(Coming Soon):*** Want to know what a certain weapon does? What happens when they're refined? 


## Future Plans

* I would like to expand on the *exp calculator* by letting you input your current exp and telling you from then on how many books you need.
* Create a new section called **Browse** where it gives the user some websites to go to for more information than what could be displayed inside the program such as the interactive map.
* Find suggestions from the public and see if something like this should continue to be developed.
